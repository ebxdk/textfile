    Abstract: Now a dayâ€™s cancer is the most prevalent life threatening disease which is spreading because of the
    lifestyle we are living. Cancer is due to uncontrolled growth of cell which can be cured if diagnosed in early
    stage of life. Treatment of cancer depends on the various internal and external factors causing cancer.
    Cancer is screened by different screening test and a number of treatments are now available these days such
    as gene therapy, chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, immunotherapy etc. In future up to 2030 around
    22.2 million cases are expected to be diagnosed for cancer.
